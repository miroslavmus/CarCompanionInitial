# CarCompanion
This is an app I've built for the "Android apps w/ Kotlin" course for the University of Plovdiv. 
The app allows its users to buld their own database of parts and documents for their cars and customize them to their will. 
It tracks the mileage of the vehicle (by user input) and checks if any parts or documents are expired.
It also provides a most basic efficiency calculator that may store the input. The calculator also shows what the last efficiency was and the average efficiency of the vehicle (only based on stored values).
Calculator supports both imperial and metric systems, and can show effeciency in both mpg and l/100km
Variants of the app (as of now: 07.03.2021) include localization for English and Bulgarian users
The app itself is powered by Kotlin and a small bit of Java for the custom elements and utility classes.
Future updates (firstly, will be a thing): 
-will include the tracking of several vehicles as well as functionality to create/delete/update/sort vehicles by criteria
-new visual elements (ones that don't suck, as opposed to the current ones)
-localization updates (up next: German, Spanish, Italian, French and simplified Chinese(yes, Chinese...))
-additional logic (that i will not state, just to keep it a surprise :)

Let's hope that Google approves the app in the future
